# Sergio's Blog

Welcome to the blog project! This is a simple Svelte-based blog site with a custom layout, background images, and Bootstrap for styling. This README will guide you through setting up and running the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/svelte-blog.git
cd svelte-blog
```

Replace your-username with your GitHub username or the relevant repository URL.

Install Dependencies
Once you've cloned the project, you need to install the project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages, including Svelte, Bootstrap, and other dependencies defined in the package.json file.

Run the Development Server
Now that the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server, and you can open the app in your browser at http://localhost:5173.

You can now start editing the project files, and the app will automatically reload to reflect your changes.

Build for Production
To build the project for production (minified and optimized), run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a build/ directory with the production-ready version of the app. You can then deploy the contents of this folder to your web server.
